                        An ingrown toenail is the most common reason why people visit a podiatrist. This condition usually affects the big toenail but can affect the lesser nails too. A piece of nail or a serrated edge pierces and penetrates the soft skin at the edge of the
                        nail, or a spike of nail penetrates the fleshy end of the toe (distal pulp).

                            This results in soreness or extreme pain, swelling and redness and often produces pus. The condition affects both men and women equally, regardless of age. Is it caused by either an injury due to physical activity, ill-fitting shoes or poor nail cutting.

                            An ingrown toenail is the most common reason why people visit a podiatrist. This condition usually
                            affects the big toenail but can affect the lesser nails too. A piece of nail or a serrated edge
                            pierces
                            and penetrates the soft skin at the edge of the nail, or a spike of nail penetrates the fleshy end
                            of
                            the toe (distal pulp).

                            A static and dynamic biomechanics assessment is an investigation into your lower limb function – looking closely for abnormalities and compensations. The assessment will focus on the structure, posture, range of motion, plantar pressure, alignment, strengths
                            and weaknesses of the foot and will include the pelvis, legs and knees and how they work together as pain in one area can indicate a weakness or structural problem in another. The information gained from a biomechanical assessment
                            forms the basis for a rehabilitation programme, or if the problem is mechanical, an orthotic will be prescribed.

                    <h4>Gait & Biomechanical Assessment</h4>
                    A static and dynamic biomechanics assessment is an investigation into your lower limb function – looking closely for abnormalities and compensations. The assessment will focus on the structure, posture, range of motion, plantar pressure, alignment, strengths
                    and weaknesses of the foot and will include the pelvis, legs and knees and how they work together as pain in one area can indicate a weakness or structural problem in another.

                    <h4>Acute and Chronic Foot pain Management</h4>
                    Musculoskeletal disorders affect bones, joints and muscles, and include pain syndromes and rarer conditions of the immune system. Musculoskeletal conditions are often multifaceted or combined with secondary conditions involving neurological, cutaneous
                    and subcutaneous, infective and immune and vascular components alongside mechanical. Podiatrists are ideally placed to lead the foot and ankle pathway and prevent unnecessary surgical interventions, by managing foot pain conservatively
                    in a local setting. Accessing the right clinician at the right time ensures that people have the best opportunity of appropriate interventions, treatments, self-management advice and rehabilitation. Podiatrists assess, diagnose and
                    offer early and ongoing treatments for musculoskeletal disorders affecting the foot, ankle and lower limb. It is important that people experiencing foot ankle and lower-limb pain can quickly and easily access a podiatrist for assessment,
                    diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation. Eg  Calcaneal or tibialis posterior never entrapment ,plantar heel pain, plantar fasciitis, plantar plate injuries, foot and ankle injuries, shin splints , sinu tarsi entrapment , severe’s and
                    achilles problems, knee and hip problem ,neuroma. hypermobility, stress fracture, osteoarthritis etc..

                    <h4>Paediatrics</h4>
                    Children’s feet are continually developing form birth to sixteen. Each individual child develops at different time frames to that of their peers and other family members. Therefore some children present with flat feet, in-toeing gait, heel pain, Severs
                    Disease, Osgood Schlaters, Dyspraxia, hypermobility, ligamentous laxity. Some even develop toe- nail conditions, ingrowing toe nails, sweaty smelly feet. With Posture Control we respond to concerns about a child’s walking style, sports
                    injuries and postural control. We treat children with special needs, sports injuries, and more common ailments.. We also treat symptomatic flat feet, Osgood Slatter’s disease and Sever’s disease. We also provide treatment to children
                    with Down Syndrome , Dyspraxia and young Athletes. We can prescribe orthotic devices to help improve motor function and to treat underlying foot injuries
